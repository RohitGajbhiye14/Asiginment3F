            Finding Nemo is a 2003 American animated comedy-drama adventure
            film[2] produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures.
            Directed by Andrew Stanton and co-directed by Lee Unkrich, the
            screenplay was written by Stanton, Bob Peterson, and David Reynolds
            from a story by Stanton. The film stars the voices of Albert Brooks,
            Ellen DeGeneres, Alexander Gould, Willem Dafoe, and Geoffrey Rush. It
            tells the story of an overprotective clownfish named Marlin (Brooks)
            who, along with a forgetful regal blue tang named Dory (DeGeneres),
            searches for his missing son Nemo (Gould). Along the way, Marlin
            learns to take risks and comes to terms with Nemo taking care of
            himself.
